                        To save some time, we'll start boiling some water (8 cup) for later. For jook / congee recipes, 
                        the water-to-rice ratio is usually very high. In Chung Sun Lau's recipe, it's 8-to-1. <br>
                        Next, we'll chop our ginger (14.2 g) into thin slices, and then into thin strips. 
                        Chop a few strands of cilantro (1 piece) and green onion (2 pieces) into small pieces.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Cut the chicken (340 g) into thin slices and place it in a bowl to marinate. <br><br>
                        Add oyster sauce (1 tbsp), cornstarch (2 tsp), chicken bouillon (0.50 tsp), and water (2 tbsp). 
                        Mix and massage the chicken and the marinade together for 30 seconds until there's no liquid left. 
                        Then, add vegetable oil (2 tbsp) to the bowl and mix it around with chopsticks for another 20 to 30 seconds. <br><br>
                        The cornstarch helps glue the flavors to the chicken, and lock the juices inside the meat. 
                        The oil helps prevent the chicken from clumping together, and also helps 
                        seal the juices inside the chicken as well. <br><br>
                        Chef's Tip: Before cutting, place a towel underneath your board to increase its stability, and 
                        decrease the chances that you'll accidentally cut yourself.

                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Pour the boiled water (8 cup) from earlier into a pot, set on high heat, and 
                        wait for the pot to boil before adding the rice (1 rice cup). 
                        It's important not to add the rice before the pot starts boiling. <br><br>
                        Once the pot (water only) is boiling, add the rice and stir it around a bit. 
                        Another important tip: Don't stir the rice once the pot is boiling yet again, otherwise 
                        it will be more likely to stick to the bottom of the pot. <br><br>
                        We'll cover the pot (water and rice) and wait until it's boiling again.

                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Once the pot is boiling again, we'll partially cover the pot and let it cook at medium heat for 25 minutes. <br><br>
                        Depending on what "medium heat" is for your stove, you might need to cook it for longer than that. <br><br>
                        Even though this step is fairly passive, it's an important one. Chung Sun Lau 
                        explains that Cantonese people are very proud and particular 
                        about the quality of their "jūk dái," or the congee base.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Once we've hit 25 minutes, we can either proceed with this step or cook it for longer. <br><br>
                        When Randy Lau and his recreated this recipe using Chung Sun Lau's instructions, 
                        they had to cook it for another 10 minutes longer because my "medium heat" wasn't hot enough. 
                        Their grains of rice were still fairly solid. It really depends on your stove, and a bit of trial and error. <br><br>
                        Anyway, if you're happy with where your rice is at, start 
                        whisking the pot rapidly and constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. This helps speed up 
                        our cooking time, and helps break down the rice into smaller, fluffier pieces. <br><br>
                        If you don't have a whisk, you'll need to cook for another 10 to 20 minutes.

                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Set the stove to high heat, and slowly add the chicken over 
                        the course of 30 to 60 seconds, stirring constantly as you go. If you add it all at once, it will clump up. <br><br>
                        Stir the chicken around for another 1 to 2 minutes. Once the pot is 
                        boiling again, check to see that the chicken is cooked through.

                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Almost there! Add the strips of ginger, as well as salt (1 tsp) and chicken bouillon (1 tsp). 
                        Stir everything around for 20 to 30 seconds.

                        Turn off the heat, and pour the jook into your favorite bowl. Garnish with the green onions and cilantro. <br><br>
